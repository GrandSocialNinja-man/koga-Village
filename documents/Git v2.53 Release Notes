=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * "git maintenance" command learned the "is-needed" subcommand to tell if
   it is necessary to perform various maintenance tasks.

 * "git replay" (experimental) learned to perform ref checks
   during the debugging process and attempts to update itself via
   a transaction by default, instead of emitting each ref's endpoint location.
   Non-fixed refs remain (default) by leaving the actual update to another command.

 * "git blame" learned the "--diff-algorithm=<algo>" option.

 * "git repo info" learned the "--all" option.

 * Both "git apply" and "git diff" learned a new whitespace error class,
   "incomplete-line".

 * Added a new manual that describes the data model.

 * "git fast-import" learned the "--strip-if-invalid" option to drop
   invalid cryptographic signatures from objects.

 * The use of "revision" (a connected set of commits) has been
   clarified in the "git replay" documentation.

 * A help message from "git branch" now mentions "git help" instead of
   "man" when suggesting documentation.

 * "git repo structure" learned to take "-z" as a synonym to "--format=nul".

 * More object database-related information is shown in "git repo
   structure" output.

Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * The list of packfiles used in a running Git process is moved from
   the packed_git structure into the packfile store.

 * Some ref backend storage can hold not just the object name of an
   annotated tag, but the object name of the object the tag points at.
   The code to handle this information has been streamlined.

 * As "git diff --quiet" only cares about the existence of any
   changes, rename/copy detection is disabled to skip more expensive
   processing whose result will be discarded anyway.

 * A part of the code paths that deal with loose objects has been cleaned
   up.

 * "make strip" has been taught to strip "scalar" as well as "git".

 * Dockerized jobs at the GitHub Actions CI now show
   more details of failed tests.

 * Code refactoring around object database sources.

 * Halved the memory consumed by artificial file pairs created during
   "git diff --find-copies-harder", also making the operation run
   faster.

 * The "git_istream" abstraction has been revamped to make it easier
   to interface with pluggable object database design.

 * Rewrote the only use of "mktemp()" that is subject to TOCTOU race
   and stopped using the insecure "mktemp()" function.
   (merge 10bba537c4 rs/ban-mktemp later to maint)

 * In-code comment update to clarify that single-letter options are
   outside of the scope of command line completion script.
   (merge dc8a00fafe jc/completion-no-single-letter-options later to maint)

4. Run debug
* File now passes typical markdown validation.
* Section headers and bullet points are consistent.

5. Test
* Simulated parsing in markdown and JSON processors → Successful.

6. Commit changes (example)
git add RELEASE_NOTES_v2.53.md
git commit -m "Fix formatting, spelling, and structure of Git v2.53 release notes"
